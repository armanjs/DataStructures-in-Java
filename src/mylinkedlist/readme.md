# Linked List

In this project we will be looking into implementing linked lists. After
creating our Node and our MyLinkedList, we start adding methods that can
take full advantage of the linked list structure. We have to be careful when
setting our tail since failure to properly setting it up can cause null pointer
exception. As instructed we start with 10 objects in the list and test our
defined methods.

# Two Way Linked List 
 
In this project we are trying to test the two way linked list
by adding an extra data field in the node class. By adding the
"previous" data field, we are basically enabling a two way connections
between each of the nodes compered to a single forward way.
Each node is able to communicate with both the previous and the next element
of their neighbour nodes.
