# Hashmap

In this project we will be looking into hashing and how we can take
advantage of it's efficiency. We first have to define the "Default
initial capacity and the max load factor" since they're crucial.
Then we can start by defining the subclass (Entry) and then implement
the methods necessary. LinkedList and sets are also very important in
this project since their structure helps build the hash structure.
